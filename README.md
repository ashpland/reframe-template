# Re-frame template with figwheel.main

Starting point for a re-frame/figwheel project using tools.deps. I'm not at all
sure how robust or best-practicey this is (caveat emptor). There are probably
better templates out there. This one is documenting my own learning path as I
try to dupe and understand what `lein` and `boot` will usually do for me (and
do it better).

Bootstrapping: `brew install clojure`

Running figwheel: `clojure -A:figwheel` (or just `make`)
